# TODOs

- Make it the best thing EVER !
- UNDO/REDO (almost done, still missing network view changes )
- Better network discovery/update. For now, the node network is evaluated very na√Øvely. Every node connected to NodeManager m_OutputNode are "recooked", no matter if their content changed or not. It would be nice to have a "CookState" or something, and make sure the node need to be recooked or it can use a cache. 
- Duplicate nodes ( Done ? )

## ImGui
- flexible modal dialog 

# Bugs to fix
 - ImGui drawing issue after window resize. ( this doesn't happen anymore, I have no idea why ...)
