# TODOs

- Make it the best thing EVER !
- UNDO/REDO
- Better network discovery/update. For now, the node network is evaluated very na√Øvely. Every node connected to NodeManager m_OutputNode are "recooked", no matter if itheir content changed or not. It would be nice to have a "CookState" or something, and make sure the node need to be recooked or use a cache. 
- Data infos panel, to get a quick preview on the data processed by the current node.
- Subnetwork operator !!
